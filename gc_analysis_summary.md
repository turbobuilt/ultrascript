# UltraScript Garbage Collector Analysis Summary

## Analysis Completed

### 1. Memory Leak Analysis ✓
- Identified **10 critical issues** that could cause memory leaks
- Key problems: missing class members, incomplete implementations, thread-local storage leaks
- Full report: `gc_memory_leak_analysis_report.md`

### 2. Performance Bottleneck Analysis ✓
- Identified **10 major performance bottlenecks**
- Most critical: stop-the-world pauses (10-1000ms), global lock contention
- Full report: `gc_performance_analysis_report.md`

### 3. Reference Counter Removal ✓
- Archived old reference counter: `memory_manager.h.old`, `memory_manager.cpp.old`
- Updated `lexical_scope.h` to remove manual reference counting
- Updated `unified_event_system.h` to remove manual reference counting

## Key Findings

### Critical Issues to Fix:
1. **Missing Implementation**: Many core GC functions are not implemented
2. **Type System**: Missing TypeInfo/TypeRegistry prevents object traversal
3. **Thread Safety**: Multiple race conditions and missing synchronization
4. **Performance**: Stop-the-world GC causes unacceptable pause times

### Recommended Next Steps:
1. Implement missing core functionality (mark/sweep, type registry)
2. Add parallel marking and concurrent collection
3. Fix thread-local storage cleanup
4. Implement incremental/concurrent GC to reduce pause times
5. Add proper testing framework

## Performance Impact
- Current implementation would have **50-90% throughput reduction**
- Pause times of **10-1000ms** are unacceptable for a high-performance language
- With fixes, could achieve **80-90% pause reduction** and **30-50% throughput improvement**
