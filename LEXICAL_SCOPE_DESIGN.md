# UltraScript Lexical Scope Implementation

## Overview

This document describes the high-performance, thread-safe lexical scope implementation for the UltraScript language. The system enables JavaScript-like lexical scoping while maintaining high performance for multi-threaded goroutine execution.

## Key Features

### 1. Thread-Safe Variable Access
- All variable operations use atomic operations and fine-grained locking
- Shared variables can be safely accessed and modified from multiple goroutines
- Lock-free reads for performance-critical paths

### 2. JavaScript-Compatible Semantics
- Goroutines have access to their lexical environment (not snapshots)
- Variables in outer scopes can be read and modified by inner functions and goroutines
- Proper scope chain traversal for variable resolution

### 3. High-Performance Design
- Lock-free atomic operations where possible
- Efficient memory management with reference counting
- Minimal overhead for variable access

### 4. Type Safety with Dynamic Casting
- Strong typing with automatic type casting following UltraScript rules
- Type information stored alongside values for runtime casting
- Support for "casting up" (int32 + float32 = float64)

## Architecture

### Core Components

#### 1. VariableBinding
```cpp
struct VariableBinding {
    std::string name;
    DataType type;
    std::atomic<void*> value_ptr;
    std::atomic<bool> is_initialized;
    std::atomic<bool> is_mutable;
    std::atomic<int64_t> ref_count;
    mutable std::shared_mutex access_mutex;
    std::atomic<DataType> runtime_type;
}
```

- **Thread Safety**: Uses atomic operations for metadata and shared_mutex for value access
- **Type Flexibility**: Stores runtime type information for dynamic casting
- **Memory Management**: Reference counting for safe cleanup

#### 2. LexicalScope
```cpp
class LexicalScope : public std::enable_shared_from_this<LexicalScope> {
private:
    std::unordered_map<std::string, std::shared_ptr<VariableBinding>> variables;
    std::shared_ptr<LexicalScope> parent_scope;
    mutable std::shared_mutex scope_mutex;
    std::atomic<uint64_t> scope_id;
}
```

- **Scope Chain**: Each scope maintains a reference to its parent
- **Variable Storage**: Hash map for O(1) variable lookup
- **Thread Safety**: Shared mutex allows concurrent reads

#### 3. ScopeChain
```cpp
class ScopeChain {
private:
    std::shared_ptr<LexicalScope> current_scope;
    std::shared_ptr<LexicalScope> global_scope;
    mutable std::mutex chain_mutex;
    thread_local static std::unique_ptr<ScopeChain> thread_local_chain;
}
```

- **Thread-Local Storage**: Each goroutine has its own scope chain
- **Global Access**: All threads can access the global scope
- **RAII Management**: Automatic scope cleanup with ScopeGuard

## Goroutine Integration

### Scope Capture
When a goroutine is spawned, the lexical scope is captured:

```cpp
auto captured_scope = current_scope->capture_for_closure();
auto promise = scheduler.spawn_with_scope(task, captured_scope);
```

### Key Design Decision: Reference vs. Copy
The implementation uses **references** to parent scopes, not copies. This means:

- Goroutines share the same variable bindings as their parent scope
- Changes made by goroutines are visible to the parent and other goroutines
- This matches JavaScript closure semantics exactly

### Thread-Local Initialization
Each goroutine initializes its thread-local scope chain:

```cpp
ScopeChain::initialize_thread_local_chain(captured_scope);
// ... execute goroutine code ...
ScopeChain::cleanup_thread_local_chain();
```

## Usage Examples

### Basic Variable Access
```ultraScript
var x: int64 = 42;

function outer() {
    var y: int64 = x + 10;  // Access parent scope
    
    go function() {
        x = x + 1;  // Modify parent scope variable
        y = y + 1;  // Modify function scope variable
    };
}
```

### Complex Scope Chains
```ultraScript
var global_var: int64 = 0;

function level1() {
    var level1_var: int64 = 10;
    
    function level2() {
        var level2_var: int64 = 20;
        
        go function() {
            // Can access all levels
            global_var = global_var + 1;
            level1_var = level1_var + 1;
            level2_var = level2_var + 1;
        };
    }
}
```

## Performance Characteristics

### Variable Access Costs
1. **Local Variable**: O(1) hash lookup + atomic load
2. **Parent Scope**: O(d) where d = scope depth + atomic load
3. **Concurrent Modification**: Shared lock acquisition overhead

### Memory Usage
- **Per Variable**: ~80 bytes (VariableBinding + metadata)
- **Per Scope**: ~40 bytes + variable map overhead
- **Reference Counting**: Automatic cleanup, no memory leaks

### Concurrency Performance
- **Read-Heavy Workloads**: Excellent (shared locks)
- **Write-Heavy Workloads**: Good (fine-grained locking)
- **Mixed Workloads**: Very good (atomic operations for metadata)

## Thread Safety Guarantees

### Variable Operations
- ✅ **Concurrent Reads**: Multiple threads can read the same variable
- ✅ **Concurrent Writes**: Writes are serialized with shared_mutex
- ✅ **Read-Write**: Reads and writes are properly synchronized
- ✅ **Type Safety**: Runtime type information prevents type confusion

### Scope Management
- ✅ **Scope Creation**: Thread-safe with atomic ID generation
- ✅ **Variable Declaration**: Protected by scope mutex
- ✅ **Variable Lookup**: Lock-free for read-only traversals
- ✅ **Reference Counting**: Atomic operations prevent use-after-free

## Integration with UltraScript Runtime

### Compiler Integration
The compiler generates appropriate scope management code:

```cpp
// Function entry
__scope_push(nullptr);  // Create new scope

// Variable declaration
__scope_declare_var("x", DataType::INT64, true);

// Variable assignment
__scope_set_var_int64("x", 42);

// Goroutine spawn with closure
void* captured = __scope_capture_for_closure(nullptr, 0);
__goroutine_spawn_with_scope("function_name", captured);

// Function exit
__scope_pop();  // Cleanup scope
```

### Runtime Functions
Complete C API for scope operations:
- Scope management: `__scope_create`, `__scope_push`, `__scope_pop`
- Variable operations: `__scope_declare_var`, `__scope_set_var_*`, `__scope_get_var_*`
- Closure support: `__scope_capture_for_closure`, `__scope_init_thread_local`

## Future Optimizations

### 1. Lock-Free Variable Access
- Implement lock-free hash maps for variable storage
- Use hazard pointers for safe memory reclamation
- Reduce contention in high-concurrency scenarios

### 2. Escape Analysis
- Detect variables that don't escape to goroutines
- Use stack allocation for non-escaping variables
- Reduce heap pressure and improve cache locality

### 3. Scope Flattening
- Optimize deep scope chains by flattening frequently accessed variables
- Cache variable lookups across scope boundaries
- Reduce scope traversal overhead

### 4. Copy-on-Write Optimization
- For read-heavy variables, use copy-on-write semantics
- Reduce lock contention for frequently read variables
- Maintain reference semantics while improving performance

## Testing and Validation
