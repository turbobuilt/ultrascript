# UltraScript Garbage Collector Memory Leak Analysis Report

## Executive Summary

The garbage collector implementation in `gc_memory_manager.h/cpp` contains numerous critical issues that could lead to memory leaks, crashes, and undefined behavior. The code appears to be incomplete and has several missing implementations, uninitialized members, and thread safety problems.

## Critical Issues Found

### 1. Missing Class Members and Undefined References

**Severity: CRITICAL**

The implementation references several class members that are not declared in the header file:

- `GarbageCollector::tlabs_mutex_` - Used but not declared
- `GarbageCollector::heap_mutex_` - Used but not declared  
- `GarbageCollector::mark_stack_` - Used but not declared
- `GarbageCollector::type_registry_` - Used but not declared
- `GarbageCollector::total_pause_time_ms_` - Used but not declared
- `GarbageCollector::max_pause_time_ms_` - Used but not declared
- `GenerationalHeap::allocate_large_slow()` - Called but not declared

**Impact**: Compilation failure and undefined behavior if these members are somehow provided elsewhere.

### 2. Missing Type System Implementation

**Severity: CRITICAL**

The code references `TypeInfo` and `TypeRegistry` classes that are not defined:
- Line 414: `TypeInfo* type_info = type_registry_.get_type(header->type_id);`
- Line 472-480: Type registration uses undefined `TypeInfo` struct

**Impact**: The GC cannot traverse object graphs without type information, leading to uncollected garbage.

### 3. Singleton Instance Memory Leak

**Severity: HIGH**

```cpp
// Line 291-296
GarbageCollector& GarbageCollector::instance() {
    if (!g_gc_instance) {
        g_gc_instance = new GarbageCollector();
        g_gc_instance->initialize();
    }
    return *g_gc_instance;
}
```

**Issues**:
- `g_gc_instance` is never deleted
- No cleanup on program termination
- Double initialization possible (constructor calls `heap_.initialize()`, then `initialize()` called again)

### 4. Thread-Local Storage Leaks

**Severity: HIGH**

```cpp
// Line 17
thread_local TLAB* GenerationalHeap::tlab_ = nullptr;

// Line 193-206
if (!tlab_) {
    // ... creates new TLAB
    tlab_ = new_tlab.get();
    GarbageCollector::instance().all_tlabs_.push_back(std::move(new_tlab));
}
```

**Issues**:
- Thread-local `tlab_` pointer is never cleaned up when threads exit
- No mechanism to remove TLABs from `all_tlabs_` when threads terminate
- Memory mapped for TLABs is never reclaimed until shutdown

### 5. Escape Analysis Data Leak

**Severity: MEDIUM**

```cpp
// Line 22-28
thread_local struct {
    std::vector<std::pair<size_t, size_t>> scope_stack;
    std::unordered_map<size_t, EscapeAnalyzer::AnalysisResult> allocation_sites;
    std::unordered_map<size_t, std::vector<size_t>> var_to_sites;
    std::unordered_map<size_t, size_t> var_scope;
    size_t current_scope = 0;
} g_escape_data;
```

**Issues**:
- Thread-local escape analysis data grows unbounded
- No cleanup mechanism when threads exit
- Maps can grow indefinitely as allocation sites accumulate

### 6. Missing Implementation for Critical Functions

**Severity: CRITICAL**

Several critical functions are declared but not implemented:
- `copy_young_survivors()` - Called in line 337 but not defined
- `update_references()` - Declared but implementation incomplete
- `perform_old_gc()` - Declared but not implemented
- `perform_full_gc()` - Declared but not implemented
- `wait_for_safepoint()` - Called but not implemented
- `release_safepoint()` - Called but not implemented

**Impact**: Core GC functionality is missing, making the collector non-functional.

### 7. Root Set Management Issues

**Severity: HIGH**

```cpp
void __gc_register_roots(void** roots, size_t count) {
    auto& gc = GarbageCollector::instance();
    for (size_t i = 0; i < count; ++i) {
        gc.add_stack_root(&roots[i]);  // Adds pointer to local array element!
    }
}
```

**Issues**:
- Registers pointers to stack array elements that become invalid after function returns
- No validation of root pointers
- `add_stack_root()` and `remove_stack_root()` not implemented

### 8. Card Table Scanning Issues

**Severity: HIGH**

```cpp
// Line 496-503
for (uintptr_t addr = card_start; addr < card_end; ) {
    ObjectHeader* header = reinterpret_cast<ObjectHeader*>(addr);
    if (header->flags & ObjectHeader::IN_OLD_GEN) {
        callback(header->get_object_start(), nullptr);
    }
    addr += sizeof(ObjectHeader) + header->size;
}
```

**Issues**:
- No validation that `addr` points to a valid object
- No bounds checking
- Assumes objects are contiguously laid out with no gaps
- Missing object map as noted in comment

### 9. Memory Mapping Cleanup Issues

**Severity: MEDIUM**

```cpp
// Line 171-189
void GenerationalHeap::shutdown() {
    // ...
    if (young_.eden_start != MAP_FAILED) {
        munmap(young_.eden_start, GCConfig::YOUNG_GEN_SIZE);
    }
    if (old_.start != MAP_FAILED) {
        munmap(old_.start, GCConfig::OLD_GEN_SIZE);
    }
}
```

**Issues**:
- Checks against `MAP_FAILED` but pointers could be non-null garbage if not initialized
- No initialization of pointers to `MAP_FAILED` in constructor
- Memory regions could be partially unmapped on error

### 10. Thread Safety Issues

**Severity: HIGH**

Multiple thread safety problems:
- `g_escape_data` is thread-local but contains shared allocation site data
- No synchronization when accessing `WriteBarrier::card_table_`
- Race conditions in TLAB allocation (checking and creating under different locks)
- `safepoint_requested_` and `threads_at_safepoint_` lack proper synchronization

### 11. Circular Reference Handling

**Severity: HIGH**

The current implementation uses simple mark-and-sweep for young generation but has no special handling for:
- Circular references between generations
- Weak references (flag exists but no implementation)
- Finalizers (flag exists but no implementation)

### 12. Resource Cleanup in Destructors

**Severity: MEDIUM**

```cpp
GarbageCollector::~GarbageCollector() {
    shutdown();
}
```

**Issues**:
- If `shutdown()` throws, destructor will terminate program
- No handling of partial cleanup states
- GC thread might still be running during destruction

## Additional Issues

### 13. Integer Overflow Possibilities

- Line 176: `card_index & (card_table_size_ - 1)` assumes size is power of 2
- No validation of allocation sizes before alignment calculations

### 14. Missing Error Handling

- No error checking for `mmap` failures in all paths
- No recovery mechanism for allocation failures
- Missing null checks in many places

### 15. Incorrect Object Model Assumptions

- Assumes all objects have `ObjectHeader` prefix, but stack-allocated objects might not
- Forward pointer field is only 16 bits, limiting heap size or object count

## Recommendations

1. **Complete Missing Implementations**: Implement all declared but undefined functions
2. **Fix Type System**: Define and implement `TypeInfo` and `TypeRegistry`
3. **Add Thread Cleanup**: Implement thread exit handlers for TLS cleanup
4. **Fix Root Registration**: Store root pointers properly, not pointers to stack
5. **Implement Object Maps**: Add proper object tracking for card table scanning
6. **Add Synchronization**: Properly protect shared data structures
7. **Implement Shutdown**: Add proper cleanup sequence with error handling
8. **Add Validation**: Validate all pointers and sizes before use
9. **Fix Memory Leaks**: 
   - Delete singleton instance on exit
   - Clean up thread-local data
   - Properly track and free all allocations
10. **Complete GC Algorithm**: Implement missing GC phases and generations

## Conclusion

The current implementation is incomplete and contains numerous critical issues that would prevent it from functioning correctly. The code would likely fail to compile due to missing members and type definitions. Even if it compiled, it would leak memory through multiple paths and likely crash due to uninitialized members and missing implementations.

A production-ready garbage collector requires careful attention to thread safety, proper resource management, and complete implementation of all GC phases. This implementation needs significant work before it could be considered functional.
