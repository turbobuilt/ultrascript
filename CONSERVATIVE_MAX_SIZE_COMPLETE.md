# Conservative Maximum Size Implementation - COMPLETE âœ…

## Overview
Successfully implemented the Conservative Maximum Size approach to handle variable-size function assignments in the UltraScript compiler. This ensures that variables receiving different function assignments are allocated sufficient memory from the beginning to accommodate the largest possible function instance.

## Problem Solved
- **Issue**: When a variable receives function assignments of different sizes (e.g., `f = simpleFunc` vs `f = closureFunc`), the memory layout becomes unpredictable and can cause corruption.
- **Solution**: Track all function sizes assigned to each variable and allocate the maximum size upfront, maintaining fixed offsets and optimal performance.

## Implementation Details

### 1. Data Structures Added
- `variable_function_sizes_`: Maps variable names to sets of assigned function sizes
- `variable_max_function_size_`: Cached maximum sizes for performance

### 2. New Methods
- `track_function_assignment()`: Records function assignments during parsing
- `finalize_function_variable_sizes()`: Computes maximum sizes before packing
- `get_max_function_size()`: Returns cached maximum size for a variable
- `has_tracked_function_sizes()`: Checks if variable has tracked assignments

### 3. Integration Points
- **Parser**: Modified assignment parsing to detect and track function assignments
- **Scope Exit**: Added finalization call before variable packing
- **Packing Algorithm**: Updated to use Conservative Maximum Size when available

## Test Results
Successfully tested with `test_variable_size_functions.gts`:
- Variable `f` receives 3 different function sizes: 16, 24, 40 bytes
- System correctly identifies maximum size as 40 bytes
- Memory allocation uses Conservative Maximum Size approach
- Fixed offsets maintained for optimal performance

## Benefits
1. **Memory Safety**: Prevents corruption from variable-size function assignments
2. **Performance**: Maintains fixed offsets and direct memory access
3. **Simplicity**: Easy to understand and implement
4. **Compatibility**: Works seamlessly with existing lexical scope system

## Output Example
```
[FunctionTracking] Tracking assignment: f = function of size 16 bytes
[FunctionTracking] Tracking assignment: f = function of size 24 bytes  
[FunctionTracking] Tracking assignment: f = function of size 40 bytes
[FunctionTracking] f: 3 assignments, sizes: 16 24 40 -> max: 40 bytes
[SimpleLexicalScope] Using Conservative Maximum Size for 'f': 40 bytes
[SimpleLexicalScope] Packed f (size=40, align=8, DataType=0) at offset 48
```

This implementation ensures ultra-high performance closure system with safe handling of variable-size function assignments.
